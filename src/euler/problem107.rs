//! Minimal network
//!
//! The following undirected network consists of seven vertices
//! and twelve edges with a total weight of 243.
//!
//!     {illustration elided}
//!
//! The same network can be represented by the matrix below.
//!
//!     	A	B	C	D	E	F	G
//!    A	-	16	12	21	-	-	-
//!    B	16	-	-	17	20	-	-
//!    C	12	-	-	28	-	31	-
//!    D	21	17	28	-	18	19	23
//!    E	-	20	-	18	-	-	11
//!    F	-	-	31	19	-	-	27
//!    G	-	-	-	23	11	27	-
//!
//! However, it is possible to optimise the network by removing some edges
//! and still ensure that all points on the network remain connected.
//! The network which achieves the maximum saving is shown below.
//! It has a weight of 93, representing a saving of 243 âˆ’ 93 = 150 from
//! the original network.
//!
//!     	A	B	C	D	E	F	G
//!    A	-	16	12	-	-	-	-
//!    B	16	-	-	17	-	-	-
//!    C	12	-	-	-	-	-	-
//!    D	-	17	-	-	18	19	-
//!    E	-	-	-	18	-	-	11
//!    F	-	-	-	19	-	-	-
//!    G	-	-	-	-	11	-	-
//!
//! Using network.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 6K text file
//! containing a network with forty vertices, and given in matrix form, find the
//! maximum saving which can be achieved by removing redundant edges whilst ensuring
//! that the network remains connected.
